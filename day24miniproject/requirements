 Mini Project 1:  Employee Management System

Create a program to manage different types of employees
(full-time, part-time, manager, intern, and contract employees).
Each employee type has specific attributes and salary calculation rules.
The system should be able to calculate the total salary for each employee based on their role and conditions.

General Requirements:

The program should allow creating employees with attributes such as name, ID, and salary-related details.
Each employee type has different attributes and salary calculation methods:

Full-Time Employees: Have a base salary, bonus, and benefits.
Part-Time Employees: Earn based on hourly rate and hours worked.
Managers: Inherit from Full-Time Employees, with additional managerial perks.
Interns: Receive a fixed stipend for a specific duration.
Contract Employees: Are paid based on contract rate and contract length.

Conditions:

1. The system must validate employee data (name, ID, salary) to ensure they are valid.
   If any invalid data is entered (e.g., negative salary), the system should provide an error message: "Invalid data entered!".
2. The system should allow calculating and displaying the total salary for each employee type.

Each employee type has specific salary rules:

Full-Time Employees: Salary is calculated as base salary + bonus + benefits.
Part-Time Employees: Salary is calculated as hourly rate * hours worked.
Managers: In addition to the full-time salary, managers should receive a 10% bonus for their managerial role.
Interns: Receive a fixed stipend.
Contract Employees: Salary is calculated as contract rate * contract length.
